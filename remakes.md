# remakes

There are many remakes, remasters, and ports of games in the _Mario_ franchise. Many of these contain changes from the original works, sometimes major.

_Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_ on Wii&nbsp;U (2014) is shown to be a direct prequel to _Super Mario 3D&nbsp;World_ (2013) in the ending and following Bonus Episode. However, in the Nintendo&nbsp;3DS and Nintendo Switch ports (2018), it is instead a prequel to _Super Mario Odyssey_ (2017).
