# Earth

Earth is the real world but inside a fictional world.

Earth is the counterpart to what we’ll call the “Mushroom World” (including the Mushroom Kingdom and other fantastical places). Mario and Luigi are often said to have come from Earth&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;specifically Brooklyn, New York City, New York, United States.

The entire Mario franchise appears to take place on Earth from _Donkey Kong_ (1981) until _Super Mario Bros._ (1985), which is set in the now-familiar Mushroom Kingdom. In these games, Mario (a.k.a. Jumpman in _Donkey Kong_) performs various jobs, including carpentry, plumbing, cement factory work, and Vietnam War bombing.

Other characters first appearing in this era include Luigi, Donkey Kong (Cranky Kong), Donkey Kong&nbsp;Jr. (Cranky Kong’s son, modern Donkey Kong’s father), Pauline (a.k.a. Lady), Foreman Spike, and everyone’s favorite, Stanley the Bugman.

Most of these games aren’t solidly set on Earth, but the arcade _Mario Bros._ (1983) takes place in the sewers of New York City (or Mario and Luigi’s house in the Atari ports). _Mario’s Bombs Away_ (1983) takes place in an unnamed war; it is likely the Vietnam War based on the soldiers’ uniforms and the background’s jungle theme. 

In _VS.&nbsp;Wrecking Crew_ (1984), Mario and Luigi wreck buildings. In _Wrecking Crew_ (1985), this setting carries over, with the added feature of mauling your boss with a hammer. _Wrecking Crew&nbsp;’98_ (1998,&nbsp;duh) has similar gameplay, this time taking place in the Mushroom Kingdom.

In _Mario is Missing!_ (1992) and _Mario’s Time Machine_ (1993), characters travel to several cities and time periods on Earth. No differentiation is made between Earth and the Mushroom World in these games.

In the DIC cartoon series&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;_The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_ (1989), _The Adventures of Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;3_ (1990), and _Super Mario World_ (1991)&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;Earth (also known as the “real world,” somehow not causing a bit of an existential crisis for the Mushroom Kingdom’s natives) is where the Mario Bros. came from after getting sucked into the Brooklyn water system while on a job. They can travel between the two worlds using warp pipes.

In the _Mario&nbsp;& Sonic_ series, characters from the titular franchises compete in Earth’s Olympic Games.

In _Mario Kart Tour_ (2019&ndash;2023) and the Booster Course Pass of _Mario Kart&nbsp;8 Deluxe_ (2017&ndash;2023), tracks based on Earth cities such as New York City, United States; Paris, France; and Sydney, Australia appear.

In _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_ (2023), Mario and Luigi travel through a warp pipe from the Brooklyn sewers to the Mushroom Kingdom, and back again.

The Nintendo GameCube versions of _NBA Street&nbsp;V3_ (2005) and _SSX on Tour_ (2005) feature Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters. Finally, we can see Luigi make a dunk on Shaquille O’Neal. Shaq never really had a chance.

Sometimes, Earth appears in sky views, like in _Super Mario Galaxy_ (2007) and _Super Mario Odyssey_ (2017), the latter of which has been described by developers as being on “an Earth.” I’m going to assume that these Earths are the Mushroom World.
