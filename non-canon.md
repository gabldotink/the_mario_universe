# non-canon

Some works have been declared non-canon in one way or another.

The _Mario&nbsp;+ Rabbids_ series is not canon, as stated by creative director Davide Soliani.

The _Super Smash Bros._ series is not canon. Aside from series creator Masahiro Sakurai saying so, the first game shows the characters as toys being played with.

The _Mario&nbsp;& Sonic_ series is probably not canon. _Sonic the Hedgehog_ is generally more concerned about continuity than _Mario_ (even if itâ€™s a bit messy sometimes), so its real-world settings and aspects of the _Mario_ universe makes it almost definitely not canon to _Sonic_. Same goes the other way, a bit less so, as _Mario_ usually does whatever.
