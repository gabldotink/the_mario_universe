# time travel

Time travel is used several times in _Mario_.

In _Yoshi’s Island DS_ (2006), Bowser and Kamek travel back in time to steal the stars from the seven star children (one of whom is, in fact, Bowser. The power was inside him all along).

In _Yoshi’s New Island_ (2014), Bowser travels back again just to be annoying. Mario also travels back, disguised as “Mr. Pipe.”

In _Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time_ (2005), Mario and Luigi and a bunch of other characters time travel using either Professor E. Gadd’s time machine or a “time hole.”

In _Mario’s Time Machine_ (1993), Bowser builds a time machine to steal ancient artifacts in order to destroy the timeline.

In the Nintendo 3DS remake of _Luigi’s Mansion_ (2018), E. Gadd sends Gooigi back in time during the events of _Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon_ (2013). He apparently does not physically time travel himself.
