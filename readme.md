# the _Mario_ universe

An attempt to outline the universe of the _Mario_ franchise in a consistent manner.

While this has, of course, been tried many times, this project takes a different approach; we assume, in the first place, that there is _no_ canon. Then, we use the little bit of canon that we _do_ have in order to get as close as possible to one. This is opposed to fitting things in to an already-established, and probably arbitrary in some fashion, canonicity.
